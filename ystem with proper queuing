    Fix Azure rate limiting issues with global rate limiter and improved retry logic
    
    - Added AzureRateLimiter singleton class to queue and throttle all Azure requests
    - Increased retry attempts from 3 to 5 for better resilience
    - Implemented exponential backoff with jitter for rate limit errors (up to 30s)
    - Added shorter backoff for other errors (up to 5s)
    - Improved error messages to include response text
    - Increased wait time between models from 5s to 10s for rate limit errors
    - Global rate limiter ensures minimum 2s between all Azure requests
    - This should resolve the 429 errors during batch processing
